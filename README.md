The code that goes with our paint-a-new-picture-everyday on the side of Amundson
project. This code is stored as an iPython notebook. It is viewable [here][1].

It is recommended that you install NumPy, Matplotlib and PIL so you can actually
edit the files. To do that, look at this [Python installation guide.][2]
Enthought is free for academia users, and the SciPy SuperPack also works (though
I'm not sure if PIL is included in this).

Also, if you're actually using the script, `main()` returns an image. Use
`main().show()` to view the image.
